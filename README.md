# Problem Set 3.2
## List Processing and Higher-Order Array Methods

### Directions
1. Clone this lab
2. Run `npm install` to load project dependencies.
3. Complete coding exercises in a file named `exercises.js` file. (You will find the questions in `problem-set.md`)
    * There is no automated test suite. You won't be able to run `npm install`
    * **You are responsible for testing the code yourself** using the examples in `problem-set.md`
4. Check for style by running `eslint exercises.js` in the terminal.
5. When you are done, push your final commits and open a PR.
